" User Interface
"

" Enable syntax highlighting

" Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
set scrolloff=1
" comment <F12. 
" Display the cursor position on the last line of the screen or in the status
" line of a window.
set ruler

" Show partial commands in the last line of the screen.
set showcmd

" Set the command window height to 2 lines, to avoid many cases of having to
" press <Enter> to continue
set cmdheight=2

" Display line numbers on the left
set number

" Display fold indicator on the left
set foldcolumn=1

" Always display the status line, even if only one window is displayed
set laststatus=2

" Enable use of the mouse for all modes
" set mouse=a

" Stop certain movements from always going to the first character of a line.
" While this behaviour deviates from that of Vi, it does what most users
" coming from other editors would expect.
set nostartofline

" No annoying sound on errors
set noerrorbells
set novisualbell
set t_vb=

" Instead of failing a command because of unsaved changes, instead raise a
" dialogue asking if you wish to save changed files.
set confirm

" Do not show extra information about the currently selected
" completion in the preview window.
set completeopt=longest,menu

" When on, splitting a window will put the new window right of the
" current one.
set splitright


"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Search
"

" Highlight searches
set hlsearch

" While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
" so far, matches.
set incsearch

" Use case insensitive search, except when using capital letters
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" When on, the :substitute flag 'g' is default on.  This means that
" all matches in a line are substituted instead of one.
set gdefault


"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Usability options
"

" Set 'nocompatible' to ward off unexpected things that your distro might
" have made, as well as sanely reset options when re-sourcing .vimrc
set nocompatible

" Attempt to determine the type of a file based on its name and possibly its
" contents. Use this to allow intelligent auto-indenting for each filetype,
" and for plugins that are filetype specific.
filetype indent plugin on

" Vim with default settings does not allow easy switching between multiple
" files in the same editor window. The 'hidden' option, which allows you to
" re-use the same window and switch from an unsaved buffer without saving it
" first. It also allows you to keep an undo history for multiple files when
" re-using the same window in this way. Note that using persistent undo also
" lets you undo in multiple files even in the same window, but is less
" efficient and is actually designed for keeping undo history after closing
" Vim entirely. Vim will complain if you try to quit without saving, and
" swap files will keep you safe if your computer crashes.
set hidden

" Quickly time out on keycodes, but never time out on mappings
set notimeout ttimeout ttimeoutlen=200

" Enhanced command-line completion.
set wildmenu

" Enables the reading of .vimrc, .exrc and .gvimrc in the current directory.
" If you switch this option on you should also consider setting the 'secure'
" option.
set exrc

" When on, :autocmd, shell and write commands are not allowed in .vimrc
" and .exrc in the current directory and map commands are displayed.
set secure

" Modelines have historically been a source of security vulnerabilities. As
" such, it may be a good idea to disable them and use the securemodelines
" script, <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1876>.
set nomodeline

" Allow backspacing over autoindent, line breaks and start of insert action
set backspace=indent,eol,start

" When on, a <Tab> in front of a line inserts blanks according to shiftwidth.
" tabstop or softtabstop is used in other places.
set smarttab

" This option specifies how keyword completion ins-completion works when
" CTRL-P or CTRL-N are used.
set complete=.,w,b,u,t,i,d,t


"------------------------------------------------------------
" Format options
"

" Indentation settings for using 4 spaces instead of tabs.
" Do not change 'tabstop' from its default value of 8 with this setup.
"set shiftwidth=4
"set softtabstop=4
"set expandtab

" Indentation settings for using hard tabs. Display tabs as four
" characters wide.
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set noexpandtab

" When opening a new line and no filetype-specific indenting is enabled, keep
" the same indent as the line you're currently on. Useful for READMEs, etc.
set autoindent

" Delete comment character when joining commented lines
set formatoptions+=j

" Map Y to act like D and C, i.e. to yank until EOL, rather than act as yy,
" which is the default
map Y y$

" Spell check
nnoremap <leader>s :set spell!<CR>

" Use <F4> to toggle between 'paste' and 'nopaste'
set pastetoggle=<F4>

" Map BACKSPACE to disable search highlighting
